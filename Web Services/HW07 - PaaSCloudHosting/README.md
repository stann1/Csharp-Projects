1. Write a "code jewels*" service. The service should enable POSTing a code jewel, GETing all code jewels and searching for code jewels by source code and by category (and retrieving them). The service should also enable voting for and against a code jewel (+ and -). Code jewels with very low scores should be deleted from the database.A code jewel has a category (e.g. "C#", "JavaScript", ...), an author's mail (e.g. me@itgeorge.net), a rating and source code.Deploy the service to AppHarbor. Implement deactivating the POSTing of code jewels through the AppHarbor interface.*A code jewel is any relatively short, but useful piece of code (e.g. checking a bit's value, recursively deleting files, etc.)
